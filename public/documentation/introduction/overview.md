# What is Data Positioning?

Data Positioning Application is a collaboration seeking to make it easier to position and present data for analysis. We are currently developing the first versions of a Data Positioning Workbench and a library of Usage Kits.

## What is the Data Positioning App?

## Data Analysis Workflow

Data analysis can be divided into a three step workflow:

1. Position source data into clean, integrated, maintainable data stores (databases, files) that support analysis,
1. Access the data stores to build applications that enable analysis,
1. Conduct the analysis.

For a comprehensive definition of data analysis please refer to this [Wikipedia Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis).

## Data Positioning Workbench

The Data Positioning Workbench is designed to help with step 1 of the data analysis workflow.

## Usage Kits

The Usage Kits are designed to help with step 2 of the data analysis workflow.

## Summary

Hopefully we can help you with steps 1 and 2 of the data analysis workflow. As for step 3 — conducing the analysis — that's up to you.

## Status

DataPositioning.app is in alpha, but it's rapidly improving. If you want to use this library in production, please say hi in our ? channel, so we can work with you on the integration. Don't be shy — please reach out if you run into any issues at all. From https://zaplib.com/docs/.
